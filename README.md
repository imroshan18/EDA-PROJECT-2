# EDA-PROJECT-2

### Introduction to Customer Churn

Customer churn is the process by which customers cease their relationship with a company or service provider, often by canceling their subscriptions, switching to a competitor, or stopping the use of the service entirely.

Summary

This project leverages Python's pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy libraries to analyze telecom customer churn. The dataset, sourced from a telecom company, underwent initial cleaning to remove unnecessary columns and handle missing values. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into customer churn patterns across various demographics and services. Visualizations such as pie charts and bar plots compared churn rates by gender and senior citizen status. Additionally, analyses by contract type and payment method highlighted significant factors influencing churn. Statistical summaries, including correlation matrices, offered deeper insights into relationships between numerical features. The project culminated in visualizations like histograms and box plots to compare monthly charges and other metrics between churned and non-churned customers. These findings aim to inform strategies for enhancing customer retention and reducing churn in telecom services.
